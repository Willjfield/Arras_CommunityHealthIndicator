# NOTES & QUESTIONS
- Where do we get pre-2000 census tracts?
- Pre-2020 ACS data included is dummy data! NOT REAL DATA
- HS or Equivalent field is slightly different in the actual data which only specifies *highest* level, not HS or greater
- Only ACS data included so far, not school level, do we definitely want this as points for schools rather than school district?

# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).
