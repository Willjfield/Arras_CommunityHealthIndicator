# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about the recommended Project Setup and IDE Support in the [Vue Docs TypeScript Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/overview.html#project-setup).

### Notes and questions

-- Location search doesn't work well and definitely needs new placement if included in production
-- Any general thoughts on icons and clustering?
-- Some data fields may need adjustment based on actual data structure
- Configuration hosting location still under consideration
- Sharepoint compatibility 
-- Great Falls High and Middle Schools have same geoid but different addresses? 1201005
-- Duplicate for 1201601 Academy for Teaching and Learning
- Let's discuss creating a github team account for North Arrow
- Hosting can be done through github or we can also create an account for Arras
-- Basemap and Location services now use an API key created with the Arras ESRI account. Should fall into the free tier but they should be aware of it.
