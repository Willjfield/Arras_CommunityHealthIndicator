Every theme is defined in main.json

Every theme must have the following fields that have the following types and match the description in parentheses:
{
    "title": string,
    "query_str": string,
    "enabled": boolean,
    "description": string,
    "config": string (filepath),
    "icon": string (filepath),
    "style": {
    "colors": {
        "icon": string (filepath),
        "circle": string (color that matches a color in the public/config/arras_branding.json colors),
    },
    "min": {
        "color": string (color that matches a color in the public/config/arras_branding.json colors),
        "value": 0
    },
    "max": {
        "color": string (color that matches a color in the public/config/arras_branding.json colors),
        "value": 100
    }
    }
}
Every theme that where "enabled" is true should link to a valid json file that actually exists for that theme as specified in the "config" field of that theme. 

If a theme does not have an "enabled" field, it should have one that is set to false. 

If a theme does not have an "enabled" field that is "true", it does not need the style to be set.

The config files for each individual theme that has "enabled" marked "true" must be in the "public/config" folder.

Each theme's individual config file must have a "indicators" item in the root that is an array of indicator config objects.

Each indicator's config object must have the following properties:

{
    "title": string,
    "geolevel": string,
    "default": "left", "right", or false,
    "has_pct": boolean,
    "has_count": boolean,
    "cohort_type": string or null,
    "geotype": string,
    "google_sheets_url": string (link to google doc csv),
    "source_name": string,
    "short_name": string (trimmed with no spaces, escape characters, or special characters),
    "layers": {
    "main": string, 
    "outline": string
    },
    "fill_color": array (valid mapbox style expression)
},

src/main.ts is the entry point to the app. It MUST do the following things:

Import dependencies
create an emitter with mitt
create an app with vue
create a pinia instance
provide mitt to the app
determine the sitePath and provide it to the app
load the main config file
verify the config file and console.warn if it finds any errors or can't load the main config file
find all the enabled categories (ie themes) and load their config files
console.warn if it finds any errors or can't load a config file
provide the configs to the app
create the vue router with a landing page route and a map route
tell the app to use pinia, vuetify, and router
mount the app successfully to the div with the id "#app"
